AI is not about making machines intelligent like humans.
It’s about making machines useful in intelligent ways.

Today’s AI is data-driven because we don’t fully understand intelligence yet.
When we understand it better, AI will look very different.

AI won’t be won by who has the smartest model,
but by who builds the smartest system around imperfect models.

Models will change every year.
Foundations last decades.
Systems last even longer.
